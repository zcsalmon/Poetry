This is the first commit in my git repository
I'd tell the whole tale, but I won't start the story
when I'd had the pick in my hand,
you were killing bricks in a van.
I wouldn't even have the very legs on which I stand
If it weren't for your hard head, and your stead hand
I really do hope, for your sake, that where you land
Is as good for you and your new man
